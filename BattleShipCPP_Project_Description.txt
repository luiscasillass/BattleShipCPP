# BattleShipCPP - Project Overview

## Introduction
BattleShipCPP is a C++ implementation of the classic Battleship game, a strategic game where players aim to sink each other's fleet of ships. The game is set on a 5x5 grid, and players take turns guessing the locations of the opponent's ships, aiming to hit and sink all ships before their own fleet is destroyed.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Grid Setup:** The game is played on a 5x5 grid. Each player positions their ships on the board, which the opponent cannot see.
- **Turn-Based Play:** Players take turns guessing the coordinates where they believe an enemy ship might be located. If the guess is correct, the ship is hit; otherwise, the guess results in a miss.
- **Ship Sinking:** When all parts of a ship have been hit, the ship is considered sunk. The player who sinks all of the opponent's ships first wins the game.
- **Random Placement:** Ships can be randomly placed on the board for quick setup, adding an element of unpredictability.

## Technical Details
- **Language:** C++
- **Key Features:** The program uses object-oriented programming principles, with classes representing ships and the game board. The game logic includes hit detection, ship status checks, and game termination conditions.
- **Platform:** The game is designed to be run in a terminal or command-line interface.

## How to Play
1. Compile the `PROYECTO_INTEGRADOR_CODE.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable in your terminal.
3. Follow the prompts to position your ships and take turns guessing the opponent's ship locations.
4. Continue until one player successfully sinks all of the opponent's ships.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Opponent:** Introduce an AI opponent to allow single-player gameplay.
- **Expanded Grid Size:** Add the option to play on larger grids for increased difficulty.
- **Multiple Ships:** Introduce different types of ships with varying sizes and hit points.
